# Churn-Reduction
Code for creating a model which can predict Customer Churn.

## Problem Description
Churn (loss of customers to competition) is a problem for companies because it is more expensive to acquire a new customer than to keep your existing one from leaving. This problem statement is targeted at enabling churn reduction using analytics concepts.

## Problem Statement
The objective of this case is to predict customer behaviour. The objective is to develop an algorithm to predict the churn based on usage pattern. The predictors provided are as follows:

● account length
● international plan
● voicemail plan
● number of voicemail messages
● total day minutes used
● day calls made
● total day charge
● total evening minutes
● total evening calls
● total evening charge
● total night minutes
● total night calls
● total night charge
● total international minutes used
● total international calls made
● total international charge
● number of customer service calls made

### Target Variable:
Churn: if the customer has churned (1 = Yes; 0 = No)

## File Description:
##### Train_data.csv:
training dataset that has customer usage pattern and respective data if the customer has moved out or not
##### Test_data.csv:
test dataset that has customer usage pattern and respective data for which we have to predcit the churn. 

### I have included the project report. 
### Soon I'll be uploading the HTML version for the same.
